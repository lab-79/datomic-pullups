# datomic-pullups

Functions to merge Datomic Pull syntax via union or intersection.

## Usage

FIXME

## Limitations

It does not currently support the full range of Datomic syntax:

- does not explicitly support `*`
- does not correctly merge attributes with function invocation syntax

These are captured in commented-out tests.
