# datomic-pullups change log

## 0.1.0

Initial version with basic support for pull union and intersection. It does not
support the full range of Datomic syntax:

- does not explicitly support `*`
- does not correctly merge attributes with function invocation syntax

See the test case for TODOs.

[0.1.0](https://github.com/lab-79/datomic-pullups/compare/bc9dcd6a582d12b3fc3b83c3c461a10ae79d3f07...0.1.0)
