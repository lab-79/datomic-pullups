# datomic-pullups change log

## 0.1.0 [Unreleased]

### Changed

Initial version with basic support for pull union and intersection. It does not
support the full range of Datomic syntax:

- does not explicitly support `*`
- does not correctly merge attributes with function invocation syntax

See the test case for TODOs.

[0.1.0]: https://github.com/your-name/datomic-pullups/compare/master...0.1.0
